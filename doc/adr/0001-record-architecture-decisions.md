# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-04-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

Furthermore, some additional clarification on how we use the sections of an ADR:

- The `Context` provides information about the requirements of the decision topic and states out the considerations made, like pros and cons of different options considered.
- The `Decision` explains the reasoning of the decision such as the main arguments.
- The `Consequences` lay out the impact on the context and the actions derived from it.
